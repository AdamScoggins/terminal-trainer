# Terminal Trainer

## 1.1 Overview

*Terminal Trainer* is a browser-based web application that is designed to provide users an interactive and engaging learning platform for command-line skills. This application simulates a terminal environment within the browser, so that users can practice and re-inforce their command-line skills via challenging exercises. Knowledge level is kept in mind, as this app aims to tailor to all different skill levels. If you're looking for extensive technical documentation, [please have a look around the wiki](wiki)!

## 1.2 Purpose and Target Audience

As someone who loves to mentor others and help them learn, I developed this guide with targets of all skill levels in mind. Individuals who are brand new to command-line interfaces will become much more comfortable when navigating around a terminal. Intermediate and experienced users will also find challening exercises that test even their vast knowledge of a CLI. Educators are also a targeted audience, as they can act as administrators to create or manage exercises, track user progress, and manage award badges.
