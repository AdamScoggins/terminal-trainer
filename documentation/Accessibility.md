# Customization and Accessibility

This section outlines the customization and accessibility for the application. This is a very important section.

## 8.1 Keyboard Navigation

Any interactable element in the Terminal Trainer application will be keyboard accessible. This is essential for the terminal itself, because it is pertinent for learners to be able to input commands into the terminal without a mouse. For the other aspects of the application, such as buttons and the modal, it is also important that keyboard access is available, as this allows users to navigate without using the mouse. The specific keyboard shortcuts will be outlined elsewhere (perhaps a terminal section).

## 8.2 ARIA Support

ARIA is another essential feature of the application, to ensure accessibility for all users. All applicable elements in this application will support proper ARIA labeling.
